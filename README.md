Ambition Box Data Analysis: Web Scraping, EDA, and Power BI Dashboard

ðŸš€ Project Overview This project focuses on extracting valuable company data from Ambition Box, performing comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and visualizing the findings through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The primary goal is to gain insights into various aspects of companies, including employee reviews, salary trends, interview processes, and job opportunities across different industries and cities.

âœ¨ Features

1. Web Scraping: Automated data extraction from Ambition Box's company listings to build a rich dataset.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis using Python to identify key trends, distributions, and correlations within the company data. This includes: Company performance metrics (Reviews, Salaries, Interviews). Job market distribution by company, industry, and city. Identification of leading companies and their presence.
4. Data Visualization: Creation of insightful static and interactive plots to represent complex data in an easily digestible format.
5. Power BI Dashboard: Development of a dynamic and intuitive dashboard for advanced interactive EDA, allowing users to slice and dice data to uncover deeper insights.
   
ðŸ›  Technologies Used

1. Python: For web scraping (using libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup) and data analysis (pandas, numpy).
2. Jupyter Notebook: For developing and documenting the data extraction and EDA process.
3. Matplotlib / Seaborn (or other visualization libraries): For generating static data visualizations during EDA.
4. Power BI Desktop: For designing and building the interactive dashboard.
5. Microsoft Excel / CSV: For data storage and intermediate processing.
   
ðŸ“Š Key Insights
